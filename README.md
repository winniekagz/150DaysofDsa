 150Days of DSA

Welcome to **150Days of DSA**! This repository contains a series of exercises and challenges designed to help you improve your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills over the course of 50 days.

Each day, you will learn a new concept and solve a problem related to that concept. By the end of the 50 days, you will have a strong understanding of key DSA topics and be well-prepared for technical interviews.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that you can download from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node Package Manager (comes with Node.js).
- **TypeScript**: Install TypeScript globally by running the following command:

  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript

Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the 150Days of DSA challenges:
1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine by running:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/150days-of-dsa.git
cd 150days-of-dsa

2. Install Dependencies

If there are any dependencies (like third-party libraries), you can install them by running:

npm install

3. Write Your Code

Navigate to the relevant day's file (e.g., day1.ts, day2.ts, etc.) and open it in your code editor. Each file contains a new challenge for that day. Write your solution in TypeScript.
4. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript

Once you have written your solution, you will need to compile the TypeScript file into JavaScript. You can do this by running:

npx tsc -w day1.ts

The -w flag tells TypeScript to watch for changes and automatically recompile the file when you modify it.
5. Run the JavaScript File

Once the TypeScript file is compiled, you will have a corresponding .js file (e.g., day1.js). You can now run the JavaScript file using Node.js:

node day1.js

Example Workflow

    Open day1.ts and write your solution.

    Compile the TypeScript code by running:

npx tsc -w day1.ts

Once compiled, run the JavaScript output:

    node day1.js

6. Daily Challenges

Each day contains a new challenge. Here are some examples of what you'll work on:

    Day 1: [Problem: Introduction to Arrays]
    Day 2: [Problem: Stacks and Queues]
    Day 3: [Problem: Linked Lists]
    ...
    Day 50: [Problem: Advanced Graph Algorithms]

7. Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and create a pull request. We're happy to accept improvements and additional challenges!
8. Notes

    Comment Your Code: Make sure to comment your solutions to explain your thought process and any steps you took to solve the problem.
    Test Your Solutions: After writing your solution, always test it to ensure correctness.
    Consistency is Key: Try to solve a challenge each day to stay consistent. By the end of the 50 days, you will have learned a lot.
